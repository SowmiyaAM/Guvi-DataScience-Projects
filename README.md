## DATA ANALYSIS
## [1. YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing](https://github.com/SowmiyaAM/Guvi-DataScience-Projects/tree/d4c08e79193e2f5e257e5d8f187f2b45a32113f0/Youtube%20Data%20Harvesting%20and%20Warehousing)
- Objective is to analyze data from multiple YouTube Channels and find insights.
- Data retrieved from YouTube API is stored as python dictionary with required channel details and inserted into MongoDB.
- Data is then migrated to MySQL database to query and display output in Streamlit Application.
- Insights such as most viewed videos, average duration of all videos, videos with highest number of likes and comments etc., are obtained for different selected channels.
- Ex - The most viewed video of "Business Man" channel is "Complete Stock Market Course" with 1130061 views.

## [2. Phone Pe Data Visualization and Exploration](https://github.com/SowmiyaAM/Guvi-DataScience-Projects/tree/d4c08e79193e2f5e257e5d8f187f2b45a32113f0/PhonePe%20Pulse%20Data%20Visualization%20and%20Exploration)
- Objective is to provide insights with data visualizations to effectively communicate the story behind.
- Data extracted from Phonepe Pulse Github repository is cleaned and processed for analysis.
- Developed a webpage app inspired from "Explore Data" of Phonepe Pulse using Streamlit to view different data fields and top charts.
- Insights such as most preferred transaction type, count of users in each brand etc., are obtained for different years, quarters and states in India.
- Ex - Average transaction value in the 4th quarter of year 2021 is Rs. 1753.

## [3. Extracting Business Card Data with OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](https://github.com/SowmiyaAM/Guvi-DataScience-Projects/tree/d4c08e79193e2f5e257e5d8f187f2b45a32113f0/Extracting%20Business%20Card%20Data%20with%20OCR)
- Objective is to extract relevant information from the uploaded image of a business card and save into a database.
- Extracted text and bytes data from the uploaded image is stored in Pandas and migrated to SQLite3.
- Developed a webpage using Streamlit to view, update and delete card details from the database.

## [4. Airbnb Data Analysis](https://github.com/SowmiyaAM/Guvi-DataScience-Projects/tree/d4c08e79193e2f5e257e5d8f187f2b45a32113f0/Airbnb%20Analysis)
- Objective is to develop an interactive geospatial visualizations with dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations and availability patterns.
- Designed Tableau Dashboard with different charts to provide overview of the data.
- Developed a webpage app to provide insights on top rated and high demand properties using Streamlit.
- Insights such as count of properties, average price of each property type, most preferred room type etc., are obtained for different countries.
- Ex - Average price of property with 2 private rooms is $1781.11 in Hongkong.
