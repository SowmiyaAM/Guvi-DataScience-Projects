## DATA ANALYSIS
## [Phone Pe Data Visualization and Exploration](https://youtu.be/Dkn5e7znxZk?si=xluYQEiddMG3Fj_q)
- Objective is to provide insights with data visualizations to effectively communicate the story behind.
- Data extracted from Phonepe Pulse Github repository is cleaned and processed for analysis.
- Developed a webpage app inspired from "Explore Data" of Phonepe Pulse using Streamlit to view different data fields and top charts.
- Insights such as most preferred transaction type, count of users in each brand etc., are obtained for different years, quarters and states in India.
- Ex - Average transaction value in the 4th quarter of year 2021 is Rs. 1753.
## [YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing](https://youtu.be/GnTL6NtRsYM?si=4h94WwA2aSQ_eMk7)
- Objective is to analyze data from multiple YouTube Channels and find insights.
- Data retrieved from YouTube API is stored as python dictionary with required channel details and inserted into MongoDB.
- Data is then migrated to MySQL database to query and display output in Streamlit Application.
- Insights such as most viewed videos, average duration of all videos, videos with highest number of likes and comments etc., are obtained for different selected channels.
- Ex - The most viewed video of "Business Man" channel is "Complete Stock Market Course" with 1130061 views.
## [Airbnb Data Analysis](https://youtu.be/73RGQdXJtAo?si=CNjziFOhbMjyJ0OL)
- Objective is to develop an interactive geospatial visualizations with dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations and availability patterns.
- Designed Tableau Dashboard with different charts to provide overview of the data.
- Developed a webpage app to provide insights on top rated and high demand properties using Streamlit.
- Insights such as count of properties, average price of each property type, most preferred room type etc., are obtained for different countries.
- Ex - Average price of property with 2 private rooms is $1781.11 in Hongkong.
## [Extracting Business Card Data with OCR](https://youtu.be/lMuuTYwXq2s?si=4IGgZ0T70AOfKbT1)
- Objective is to extract relevant information from the uploaded image of a business card and save into a database.
- Extracted text and bytes data from the uploaded image is stored in Pandas and migrated to SQLite3.
- Developed a webpage using Streamlit to view, update and delete card details from the database.
## MACHINE LEARNING
## [Industrial Copper Modeling](https://youtu.be/DJmqOGkxGzg?si=1KcZGlTaCWVD-mnO)
- Objective is to address the challenges of manual price estimation and lead classification with predictive analytics.
- Preprocessed data is used for training and testing with different ML algorithms to get best accuracy score.
- Built a Regression model with R2 score of 0.96 (XGBoost Regressor) for accurately predicting the Selling Price.
- Built a Classification model with accuracy score of 0.964 (Random Forest Classifier) for precisely predicting the success or failure of lead status.
- Developed a webpage app to get required user inputs for prediction using Streamlit.
## [Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction](https://youtu.be/sF5eu38OjYg?si=cdIltKLobURJXRVD)
- Objective is to assist both buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat in Singapore with predictive analytics.
- Data is extracted from HDB (Singapore Housing and Development Board) for the years 1990 to Till Date.
- Preprocessed data is then used for training and testing with different ML algorithms to get best R2 score.
- Built a Regression model with best R2 score of 0.91 (Random Forest Regressor) for accurately predicting the resale price.
- Developed a webpage app to get required user inputs for prediction using Streamlit.
## [Predicting Term Deposit Subscription by a Client](https://youtu.be/ZhqQSfwZiBM?si=5BVORqGMMlWc5IP7)
- Objective is to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit or not, when contacted by a marketing agent.
- Extracted Data is cleaned by removing outliers and processed using encoders.
- Built a Classification model with accuracy score of 0.92 (SVM Classifier) for accurately predicting the outcome.
- Developed a webpage app to get required user inputs for prediction using Streamlit.
## [Predicting Breast Cancer in a Patient](https://youtu.be/5F0nB-B3ays?si=Vi0KP6_0sznzSduP)
- Objective is to predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques.
- Built a Classification model with accuracy score of 0.96 (Random Forest Classifier) for accurately predicting the outcome.
- Developed a webpage app to get required user inputs for prediction using Streamlit.
